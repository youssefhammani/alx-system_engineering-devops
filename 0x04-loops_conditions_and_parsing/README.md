# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Description
This repository contains Bash scripts that demonstrate the use of loops, conditions, and parsing. The scripts cover various tasks related to file operations, conditional statements, and loop constructs.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Create SSH RSA key pairs
- Understand the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- Use while, until, and for loops
- Implement if, else, elif, and case condition statements
- Utilize the cut command for text processing
- Work with file test operators and other comparison operators
- Ensure script portability and compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Project Structure

- **0-RSA_public_key.pub:** Contains the public RSA key generated for SSH access.
- **1-for_best_school:** Bash script using a for loop to display "Best School" 10 times.
- **2-while_best_school:** Bash script using a while loop to display "Best School" 10 times.
- **3-until_best_school:** Bash script using an until loop to display "Best School" 10 times.
- **4-if_9_say_hi:** Bash script displaying "Best School" with an additional "Hi" on the 9th iteration.
- **5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance:** Bash script with conditional statements to display different messages.
- **6-superstitious_numbers:** Bash script using a case statement to display messages for specific loop iterations.
- **7-clock:** Bash script displaying the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a while loop.
- **8-for_ls:** Bash script using a for loop to list the contents of the current directory.
- **9-to_file_or_not_to_file:** Bash script with if-else statements to check and provide information about a file.
- **10-fizzbuzz:** Bash script displaying numbers from 1 to 100 with conditions for Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.
