# Web Stack Debugging #1

This repository contains solutions for the "Web Stack Debugging #1" project as part of the ALX School curriculum.

## Project Description

In this project, we were tasked with debugging issues related to a misconfigured Nginx web server running on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS container. The main objective was to ensure that Nginx was properly configured to listen on port 80 and serve web content accordingly.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Nginx likes port 80

The task involved identifying and fixing the issue preventing Nginx from listening on port 80. A Bash script was created to automate the debugging and fixing process.

### Task 1: Make it sweet and short

This task required us to optimize the Bash script from Task 0, ensuring it remained concise while achieving the same functionality.

## Directory Structure

- `0-nginx_likes_port_80`: Contains the Bash script for Task 0.
- `1-debugging_made_short`: Contains the optimized Bash script for Task 1.

## Usage

To use the provided Bash scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective task directory.
3. Make the Bash script executable using the command `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
4. Run the Bash script using `./script_name.sh`.
