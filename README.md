The one-liner scripts provided in my  response are used to print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name of the directory that the user is currently in and where relative paths are based on. The purpose of these scripts is to allow the user to determine their current location in the file system, and to obtain the absolute path of the current working directory, which can be useful in various contexts such as writing relative paths to files and directories. These scripts provide the desired information in a compact and efficient manner, all in one line of code.
