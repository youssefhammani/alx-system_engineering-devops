## Introduction

This project involves setting up a web infrastructure to serve dynamic content and API endpoints. It utilizes Flask as the web framework, Gunicorn as the WSGI server, and Nginx as the reverse proxy server.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Python 3
- Flask
- Gunicorn
- Nginx

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up development with Python

- Ensure SSH access to your server.
- Install the `net-tools` package: `sudo apt install -y net-tools`.
- Clone the AirBnB_clone_v2 repository.
- Configure `web_flask/0-hello_route.py` to serve content from the route `/airbnb-onepage/` on port 5000.

### 2. Set up production with Gunicorn

- Install Gunicorn and necessary libraries.
- Serve the same content from the same route as in the previous task using Gunicorn bound to port 5000.

### 3. Serve a page with Nginx

- Configure Nginx to serve the page from the route `/airbnb-onepage/`.
- Nginx should proxy requests to the process listening on port 5000.

### 4. Add a route with query parameters

- Configure Nginx to proxy requests to the route `/airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer)` to a Gunicorn instance listening on port 5001.

### 5. Serve your AirBnB clone

- Clone the AirBnB_clone_v4 repository.
- Serve content from `web_dynamic/2-hbnb.py` on port 5003.
- Configure Nginx to serve the website both locally and on its public IP on port 5003 and properly serve static assets.
