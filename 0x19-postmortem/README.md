 Postmortem: The Great Database Disaster

## Issue Summary

**Duration**: March 10, 2024, 3:00 PM - March 11, 2024, 9:00 AM (UTC)
**Impact**: Database service outage resulted in slow response times, affecting 80% of users
**Root Cause**: Database server overload due to unoptimized queries

## Timeline

- **3:00 PM**: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high CPU usage on database server
- **3:15 PM**: Investigation initiated by DevOps team to identify the cause of the high CPU usage
- **4:00 PM**: Initial assumption made that a recent code deployment may have caused inefficient database queries
- **5:30 PM**: Development team involved to analyze recent code changes and their impact on database performance
- **6:00 PM**: Misleading assumption of a potential network issue explored and ruled out
- **7:30 PM**: Incident escalated to senior database administrator for further analysis
- **8:30 PM**: Root cause identified as poorly optimized database queries leading to excessive resource consumption
- **9:00 PM**: Immediate resolution implemented by optimizing the problematic queries and restarting the database server

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: Unoptimized database queries causing high CPU usage and server overload
- **Resolution**: Optimized queries to reduce resource consumption and restarted the database server to restore normal functionality

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Improve query optimization practices to prevent similar issues in the future
- Implement regular code reviews to identify and address inefficient database queries
- Set up additional monitoring alerts for early detection of resource-intensive queries
- Conduct performance testing before deploying code changes to production environment
