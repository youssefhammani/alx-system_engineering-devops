Explain what this command does  "su betty"

The su command in Linux is used to switch the current user to another user. The betty argument in this case specifies the target user to switch to.

When executed, the su command will prompt for the target user's password. If the password is entered correctly, the current user's shell is replaced by a new shell with the specified user's environment variables, current working directory, and other attributes.

The su command is commonly used by system administrators to switch to other users for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes. It is also used by normal users to temporarily elevate their privileges to perform tasks that require elevated permissions.
