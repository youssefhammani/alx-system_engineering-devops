> echo "Hello, World"

** echo "Hello, world" is a command that prints the string "Hello, world" to the terminal or console.

The echo command is a basic command that is used to display a line of text or string on the terminal or console. It takes one or more arguments, which are the strings or variables that you want to display.

In this case, the argument is the string "Hello, world", which is enclosed in double quotes to indicate that it is a single string. The double quotes are not printed to the terminal, only the content of the string is printed. **

> echo \"\(Ôo\)\'

** The echo command is used to display the text to the terminal.
The backslash character (\) before the double quotes (") and the single quote (') tells the shell to treat them as literal characters rather than special characters that are used for shell interpretation.
The double quotes are used to enclose the entire string that we want to print to the terminal.
The backslash character before the left parenthesis (() and the right parenthesis ()) tells the shell to treat them as literal characters rather than special characters that are used for grouping expressions or function calls.
The left parenthesis and the letter O, separated by the accent circumflex symbol (^), create a face with a raised eyebrow and a snout (Ôo).
The single quote character at the end of the string is used to close the string and also to escape the double quote character that appears earlier in the string. **
