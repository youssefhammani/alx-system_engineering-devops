The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "$(pwd)"

is a Bash script that prints the current working directory.

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, echo "$(pwd)", uses the pwd command to get the current working directory, and the echo command to print it to the console. The $(pwd) syntax is called command substitution, and it allows the output of the pwd command to be passed as an argument to the echo command.

When this script is executed, it will print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name starting from the root directory of the file system. This makes it easier to locate the directory, as it gives the exact location of the directory in the file system.
