The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "$(pwd)"

is a Bash script that prints the current working directory.

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, echo "$(pwd)", uses the pwd command to get the current working directory, and the echo command to print it to the console. The $(pwd) syntax is called command substitution, and it allows the output of the pwd command to be passed as an argument to the echo command.

When this script is executed, it will print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name starting from the root directory of the file system. This makes it easier to locate the directory, as it gives the exact location of the directory in the file system.



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls

is used to display the contents list of the current directory. The script is written in the Bash shell scripting language and uses the ls command to list the contents of the current directory.

When executed, the script outputs a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory. This makes it easier for the user to view the contents of the current directory and navigate the file system. The ls command is a commonly used tool in Unix-like operating systems, and is a simple yet powerful way to view the contents of a directory.


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
cd ~

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, cd ~, is a command that changes the working directory to the user's home directory. The tilde (~) symbol is a shorthand for the home directory in Unix-like operating systems, so cd ~ changes the current working directory to the user's home directory.

When this script is executed, it will change the current working directory to the user's home directory, regardless of where the script was run from originally. This makes it easier to navigate the file system and access files in the home directory without having to specify the full path name.
