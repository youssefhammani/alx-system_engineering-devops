The following script:

bash

--------------------
|  #!/bin/bash     |
|  echo "$(pwd)"   |
--------------------

is a Bash script that prints the current working directory.

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, echo "$(pwd)", uses the pwd command to get the current working directory, and the echo command to print it to the console. The $(pwd) syntax is called command substitution, and it allows the output of the pwd command to be passed as an argument to the echo command.

When this script is executed, it will print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name starting from the root directory of the file system. This makes it easier to locate the directory, as it gives the exact location of the directory in the file system.


		------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

------------------
|  #!/bin/bash   |
|  ls            | 
------------------

is used to display the contents list of the current directory. The script is written in the Bash shell scripting language and uses the ls command to list the contents of the current directory.

When executed, the script outputs a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory. This makes it easier for the user to view the contents of the current directory and navigate the file system. The ls command is a commonly used tool in Unix-like operating systems, and is a simple yet powerful way to view the contents of a directory.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

------------------
|  #!/bin/bash   |
|  cd ~          |
------------------

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, cd ~, is a command that changes the working directory to the user's home directory. The tilde (~) symbol is a shorthand for the home directory in Unix-like operating systems, so cd ~ changes the current working directory to the user's home directory.

When this script is executed, it will change the current working directory to the user's home directory, regardless of where the script was run from originally. This makes it easier to navigate the file system and access files in the home directory without having to specify the full path name.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

-------------------
|  #!/bin/bash    |
|  ls -l          |
-------------------

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, ls -l, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the contents of the current directory and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

------------------
|  #!/bin/bash   |
|  ls -la        |
------------------


The second line, ls -la, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

-------------------
|  #!/bin/bash    |
|  ls -lan        |
-------------------


The second line, ls -lan, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output. The -n option tells ls to display user and group IDs numerically, rather than as names.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list, including the numeric user and group IDs. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

------------------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash                     |
|  mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory   |
------------------------------------


This script uses the `mkdir` command to create a directory in the specified path `/tmp/my_first_directory`.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

--------------------------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash                             |
|  mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory   |
--------------------------------------------


This script uses the `mv` command to move the file betty from the `/tmp/` directory to the 	`/tmp/my_first_directory` directory.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

----------------------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash                         |
|  rm /tmp/my_first_directory/betty    |
----------------------------------------


This script uses the `rm` command to remove the file `betty` from the `/tmp/my_first_directory` directory.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

-------------------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash                      |
|  rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory   |
-------------------------------------


rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory is a shell command that is used to delete a directory and all its contents. The command rm is used to remove files and directories, and the options -r and -f are used to remove a directory and its contents, and to force the removal without confirmation, respectively.

The option -r stands for "recursive" and means that the contents of the directory, including subdirectories and their contents, should be deleted as well. The option -f stands for "force" and means that the removal should be done without confirmation, even if the files are write-protected.

So, the command rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory is used to delete the directory my_first_directory and all its contents, located in the /tmp directory, without any confirmation prompts. This is a powerful and dangerous command, as it can delete an entire directory and all its contents with just one command. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when you are sure that the contents of the directory can be deleted.


		--------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

-----------------
|  #!/bin/bash  |
|  cd -         |
-----------------


This script uses the cd command with the - option, which changes the working directory to the previous one in the directory stack.


		-----------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

--------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash           |
|  ls -al ../.. /boot;   |
--------------------------

The command ls -al ../.. /boot lists all files in the long format (-al option) in three directories:

The parent of the parent directory of the current directory (../..)
The current directory (.)
The /boot directory (/boot)
The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. The -a option tells ls to display hidden files, which are normally hidden because their names start with a dot (.). The -l option tells ls to display the contents in long format, which includes information such as file permissions, owner, size, and timestamps.

So this command will display all files, including hidden files, in the long format in the current directory, the parent of the parent directory of the current directory, and the /boot directory.


		---------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

-----------------------
|  #!/bin/bash        |
|  ls -la . .. /boot  |
-----------------------


The command ls -la . .. /boot lists the contents of the current directory (.), the parent of the current directory (..), and the /boot directory (/boot), in long format. The -l option specifies that the output should be in long format, which includes the file permissions, number of links, owner and group, size, and date of modification, among other things. The -a option includes files that are normally hidden from view, as they start with a period (.) character. The contents of each of the directories will be displayed one after the other in the order specified on the command line.


		-----------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

-------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash          |
|  file /tmp/iamafile   |
-------------------------


The command file /tmp/iamafile is used to determine the type of the file named iamafile located in the /tmp directory. The file utility checks the contents of the file and reports what it believes the type of the file is based on the format and structure of the data stored in the file. The output from the file command provides information about the type of file, such as whether it's an executable file, a text file, an image file, etc. This information is useful in determining how to process or handle the file in question.


		---------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

---------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash            |
|  ln -s /bin/ls __ls__   |
---------------------------


The command ln -s /bin/ls __ls__ creates a symbolic link in the current working directory with the name __ls__, which points to the file /bin/ls.

In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, symbolic links are similar to shortcuts in other operating systems. They allow you to create a new name for a file or directory that points to the original file or directory. When you access the symbolic link, you're actually accessing the file or directory it points to. In this case, the symbolic link __ls__ will behave like the /bin/ls file.

The ln command is used to create links between files, and the -s option specifies that a symbolic link should be created, as opposed to a hard link.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash         |
|  cp -un *.tml ../    |
------------------------

The command cp -un *.html ../ is a shell command used to copy HTML files (files with the extension ".html") from the current working directory to the parent directory of the working directory. The options -u and -n are used as follows:

-u : This option tells the cp command to copy files only if the source file is newer than the destination file, or if the destination file doesn't exist.

-n : This option tells the cp command to never overwrite an existing file.

*.html : This is a shell globbing pattern that matches all files in the current directory with the extension ".html".

../ : This is the parent directory of the working directory. The ../ syntax is used to refer to the parent directory in a shell.

So, in summary, the command cp -un *.html ../ copies all the HTML files in the current directory to the parent directory, but only if the source file is newer than the destination file, or if the destination file doesn't exist, and without overwriting any existing files in the parent directory.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash         |
|  mv [A-Z]* /tmp/u    |
------------------------

This is a command that moves all files in the current working directory that begin with an uppercase letter to the directory "/tmp/u". The command uses the mv command, which is used to move files from one location to another. The [A-Z]* is a regular expression that matches all filenames in the current working directory that start with an uppercase letter. The /tmp/u at the end of the command is the destination directory where the matched files will be moved to.


		---------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

------------------
|  #!/bin/bash   |
|  rm *~         |
------------------

The rm *~ command is a one-liner in bash that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.

The rm command is used to remove files or directories in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. The *~ is a glob pattern, which is a string that can match one or more filenames. The * matches any string of characters, and the ~ matches the tilde character.

So, when the command rm *~ is executed, it searches for all files in the current working directory that end with ~, and removes them. The * wildcard character is used to match any string of characters, and the ~ matches the tilde character, so this command will remove any file that ends with a tilde in the current working directory.

It's important to use this command with caution, as once a file is deleted, it cannot be easily recovered. It's always a good idea to make a backup of your important files before using the rm command.


		------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

-------------------------------
|  #!/bin/bash                |
|  mkdir -p welcome/to/school |
-------------------------------

The mkdir command is used in the terminal to create a new directory. The -p option is used to create parent directories as needed.

So, the command mkdir -p welcome/to/school creates the directory school and, if they do not exist, the parent directories welcome and to. The -p option allows mkdir to create the entire directory path, including any intermediate directories that do not exist.

This command will create the directory school and its parent directories welcome and to, if they do not already exist. The -p option ensures that the command will not fail if any of the parent directories already exist.

Note that mkdir can be used to create a single directory or multiple directories in one command.


		--------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

--------------------
|  #!/bin/bash     |
|  ls -map         |
--------------------


The ls -map command is not a recognized option for the ls command. The ls command is used to list the files and directories in a directory.

There are several commonly used options for the ls command:

-a or --all: Show all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot .)
-l or --long: List files in a long format, displaying detailed information about each file, including permissions, owner, group, size, timestamps, and filename
-h or --human-readable: Show file sizes in human-readable format, e.g. 1K, 234M, 2G, etc.
-r or --reverse: Reverse the order of the file listing
-t or --sort-time: Sort files by modification time, newest first
So, if you want to list all the files, including hidden files, and show file sizes in human-readable format, you can use the command ls -alh.
