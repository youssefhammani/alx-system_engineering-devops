The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "$(pwd)"

is a Bash script that prints the current working directory.

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, echo "$(pwd)", uses the pwd command to get the current working directory, and the echo command to print it to the console. The $(pwd) syntax is called command substitution, and it allows the output of the pwd command to be passed as an argument to the echo command.

When this script is executed, it will print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name starting from the root directory of the file system. This makes it easier to locate the directory, as it gives the exact location of the directory in the file system.

The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls

is used to display the contents list of the current directory. The script is written in the Bash shell scripting language and uses the ls command to list the contents of the current directory.

When executed, the script outputs a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory. This makes it easier for the user to view the contents of the current directory and navigate the file system. The ls command is a commonly used tool in Unix-like operating systems, and is a simple yet powerful way to view the contents of a directory.

The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
cd ~

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, cd ~, is a command that changes the working directory to the user's home directory. The tilde (~) symbol is a shorthand for the home directory in Unix-like operating systems, so cd ~ changes the current working directory to the user's home directory.

When this script is executed, it will change the current working directory to the user's home directory, regardless of where the script was run from originally. This makes it easier to navigate the file system and access files in the home directory without having to specify the full path name.

The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -l

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, ls -l, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the contents of the current directory and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -la


The second line, ls -la, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -lan


The second line, ls -lan, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output. The -n option tells ls to display user and group IDs numerically, rather than as names.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list, including the numeric user and group IDs. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory


This script uses the `mkdir` command to create a directory in the specified path `/tmp/my_first_directory`.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory


This script uses the `mv` command to move the file betty from the `/tmp/` directory to the 	`/tmp/my_first_directory` directory.
