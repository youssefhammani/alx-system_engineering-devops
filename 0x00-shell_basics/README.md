The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "$(pwd)"

is a Bash script that prints the current working directory.

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, echo "$(pwd)", uses the pwd command to get the current working directory, and the echo command to print it to the console. The $(pwd) syntax is called command substitution, and it allows the output of the pwd command to be passed as an argument to the echo command.

When this script is executed, it will print the absolute path of the current working directory, which is the full path name starting from the root directory of the file system. This makes it easier to locate the directory, as it gives the exact location of the directory in the file system.

The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls

is used to display the contents list of the current directory. The script is written in the Bash shell scripting language and uses the ls command to list the contents of the current directory.

When executed, the script outputs a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory. This makes it easier for the user to view the contents of the current directory and navigate the file system. The ls command is a commonly used tool in Unix-like operating systems, and is a simple yet powerful way to view the contents of a directory.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
cd ~

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, cd ~, is a command that changes the working directory to the user's home directory. The tilde (~) symbol is a shorthand for the home directory in Unix-like operating systems, so cd ~ changes the current working directory to the user's home directory.

When this script is executed, it will change the current working directory to the user's home directory, regardless of where the script was run from originally. This makes it easier to navigate the file system and access files in the home directory without having to specify the full path name.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -l

The first line, #!/bin/bash, is called the shebang line and it specifies the location of the interpreter for the script. In this case, the script is interpreted by the Bash shell.

The second line, ls -l, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the contents of the current directory and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-----------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -la


The second line, ls -la, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -lan


The second line, ls -lan, is a command that lists the contents of the current directory, including hidden files, in a long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically. The -l option tells ls to display the contents in a long format, with each file and subdirectory displayed on a separate line with additional information such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps. The -a option tells ls to include hidden files in the output. The -n option tells ls to display user and group IDs numerically, rather than as names.

When this script is executed, it will display a list of all the files and subdirectories within the current working directory, including hidden files, with additional information displayed for each item in the list, including the numeric user and group IDs. This makes it easier to view and understand the complete contents of the current directory, including hidden files, and the properties of each file and subdirectory.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory


This script uses the `mkdir` command to create a directory in the specified path `/tmp/my_first_directory`.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory


This script uses the `mv` command to move the file betty from the `/tmp/` directory to the 	`/tmp/my_first_directory` directory.


		-------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
rm /tmp/my_first_directory/betty


This script uses the `rm` command to remove the file `betty` from the `/tmp/my_first_directory` directory.


		--------------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory


rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory is a shell command that is used to delete a directory and all its contents. The command rm is used to remove files and directories, and the options -r and -f are used to remove a directory and its contents, and to force the removal without confirmation, respectively.

The option -r stands for "recursive" and means that the contents of the directory, including subdirectories and their contents, should be deleted as well. The option -f stands for "force" and means that the removal should be done without confirmation, even if the files are write-protected.

So, the command rm -rf /tmp/my_first_directory is used to delete the directory my_first_directory and all its contents, located in the /tmp directory, without any confirmation prompts. This is a powerful and dangerous command, as it can delete an entire directory and all its contents with just one command. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when you are sure that the contents of the directory can be deleted.


		--------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
cd -


This script uses the cd command with the - option, which changes the working directory to the previous one in the directory stack.


		-----------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -al ../.. /boot;


The command ls -al ../.. /boot lists all files in the long format (-al option) in three directories:

The parent of the parent directory of the current directory (../..)
The current directory (.)
The /boot directory (/boot)
The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. The -a option tells ls to display hidden files, which are normally hidden because their names start with a dot (.). The -l option tells ls to display the contents in long format, which includes information such as file permissions, owner, size, and timestamps.

So this command will display all files, including hidden files, in the long format in the current directory, the parent of the parent directory of the current directory, and the /boot directory.


		---------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
ls -la . .. /boot


The command ls -la . .. /boot lists the contents of the current directory (.), the parent of the current directory (..), and the /boot directory (/boot), in long format. The -l option specifies that the output should be in long format, which includes the file permissions, number of links, owner and group, size, and date of modification, among other things. The -a option includes files that are normally hidden from view, as they start with a period (.) character. The contents of each of the directories will be displayed one after the other in the order specified on the command line.


		-----------------------------------------------------------------


The following script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
file /tmp/iamafile


The command file /tmp/iamafile is used to determine the type of the file named iamafile located in the /tmp directory. The file utility checks the contents of the file and reports what it believes the type of the file is based on the format and structure of the data stored in the file. The output from the file command provides information about the type of file, such as whether it's an executable file, a text file, an image file, etc. This information is useful in determining how to process or handle the file in question.
